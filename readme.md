## SRS Business: Simple Room Reservation for Businesses

This is a simple system that allows you to reserve rooms for a period of time.

## Motivation

More than once I've been in a situation where one does not know if a meeting room is occupied or not without actually going there.

Hopefully, the next time a similar situation might happen, this can be used to prevent it.

## Installation

This, when done, should be a simple packaged npm module, running as its own node instance.

This will probably require a sqlite database or similar for data storage.

## Code Example TODO

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## API Reference TODO

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests TODO

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors TODO

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
